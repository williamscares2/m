    <h2>The Science Behind Ugandan Chapati</h2>
    <p>
        The unique texture and flavor of Ugandan chapati are a result of a careful balance of ingredients and techniques. 
        Here's a breakdown of the science behind this delicious flatbread:
    </p>

    <p>
         All-purpose flour provides the structure for the chapati. The gluten proteins in the flour, when combined with water, form a network that gives the dough its elasticity. 
        Kneading the dough develops the gluten network, resulting in a softer and more pliable chapati.
    </p>

    <p>
         Water is essential for hydrating the flour and activating the gluten proteins. The amount of water added affects the dough's consistency. Too much water can lead to a sticky dough, while too little can result in a dry and crumbly chapati.
    </p>

    <p>
         Cooking the chapati on a hot griddle or tawa involves a complex process of heat transfer and moisture evaporation. As the chapati cooks, the water in the dough evaporates, causing the gluten network to set and the chapati to become crispy.
    </p>

    <p>
        By understanding the science behind chapati-making, you can experiment with different techniques and ingredients to create your own unique variations of this beloved Ugandan dish.
